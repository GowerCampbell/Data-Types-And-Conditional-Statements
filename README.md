# Python Data Types & Conditional Statements Journal

This repository is a collection of Python examples and explanations demonstrating key concepts, including **string manipulation**, **arithmetic operations**, **conditional statements**, **user interaction**, and more. Each section includes practical examples and Python scripts to showcase how these concepts can be implemented in real-world programming scenarios.

## Overview of Content

### 1. **String Manipulation**
   - **Objective**: Learn to work with strings, concatenate, slice, and manipulate text.
   - **Key Concepts**: String formatting, indexing, slicing, and built-in string methods.
   - **Python File**: [string_manipulation.py](string_manipulation.py)

### 2. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - **Objective**: Understand basic arithmetic operations in Python.
   - **Key Concepts**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and mathematical functions.
   - **Python File**: [arithmetic_operations.py](arithmetic_operations.py)

### 3. **Conditional Statements**
   - **Objective**: Learn to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.
   - **Key Concepts**: Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), comparison operators, and nested conditions.
   - **Python File**: [conditional_statements.py](conditional_statements.py)

### 4. **User Interaction**
   - **Objective**: Take user input and make decisions based on that input.
   - **Key Concepts**: `input()` function, type conversion, and conditional checks.
   - **Python File**: [user_interaction.py](user_interaction.py)

### 5. **Triathlon Award Program**
   - **Objective**: Create a program that assigns awards based on the user's performance in a triathlon.
   - **Key Concepts**: Using `if` statements and comparison operators to determine awards.
   - **Python File**: [triathlon_award.py](triathlon_award.py)

### 6. **Time-Based Greeting**
   - **Objective**: Greet the user based on the time of day.
   - **Key Concepts**: `datetime` module and conditional logic.
   - **Python File**: [time_based_greeting.py](time_based_greeting.py)

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-data-types-journal.git
   cd python-data-types-journal
   ```

2. **Run the Python Files**:
   - Each Python file is self-contained and can be run independently.
   - For example, to run the `triathlon_award.py` file:
     ```bash
     python triathlon_award.py
     ```

3. **Explore the Code**:
   - Open the Python files in your favorite code editor to see the implementation details.
   - Read the comments and notes within the code to understand the logic.

## Example Code Snippets

### String Manipulation
```python
# Example: String slicing and concatenation
text = "Hello, World!"
print(text[0:5])  # Output: Hello
print(text[-6:-1])  # Output: World
```

### Arithmetic Operations
```python
# Example: Basic arithmetic operations
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 13
print(a % b)  # Output: 1
```

### Conditional Statements
```python
# Example: Using if-elif-else
age = 18
if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age < 20:
    print("Teenager")
else:
    print("Adult")
```
