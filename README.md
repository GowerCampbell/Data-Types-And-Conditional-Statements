# Python Data Types & Conditional Statements Journal

This repository is a collection of examples and explanations demonstrating key Python concepts, including string manipulation, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, user interaction, and more. Each section aims to showcase how these concepts can be implemented in real-world programming scenarios, such as creating a triathlon award program or a time-based greeting system.

## Overview of Content

### 1. **String Manipulation**
   - **Objective**: Learn to work with strings, concatenate, slice, and manipulate text.
   - **Key Concepts**: String formatting, indexing, and slicing.

### 2. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - **Objective**: Understand basic arithmetic operations in Python.
   - **Key Concepts**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation.

### 3. **Conditional Statements**
   - **Objective**: Learn to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.
   - **Key Concepts**: Logical operators, comparisons, conditional expressions.

### 4. **User Interaction**
   - **Objective**: Take user input and make decisions based on that input.
   - **Key Concepts**: `input()` function, type conversion, and conditional checks.

### 5. **Triathlon Award Program**
   - **Objective**: Create a program that assigns awards based on the user's performance in a triathlon.
   - **Key Concepts**: Using `if` statements and comparison operators to determine awards.

### 6. **Time-Based Greeting**
   - **Objective**: Greet the user based on the time of day.
   - **Key Concepts**: `datetime` module and conditional logic.
